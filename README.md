A simple weather app built with **React.js** as part of my learning journey. This application fetches real-time weather data and displays the current weather conditions of any city you search.

## 📖 About

This project is designed to help me understand the core concepts of **React** including:

- Components

The app uses the **OpenWeatherMap API** to display temperature, weather status (like Cloudy, Rainy, etc.), and location details.
